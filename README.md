# RPG_Game
```A small RPG game for the console. Purpose is to try to learn OOP.```
The game has you enter a name on starting up (if a name isn't input, resort to a default value). The code then enters into loop, where you have 
the options to 1: enter a shop, 2: fight in a battleground, 3: quit the game.
